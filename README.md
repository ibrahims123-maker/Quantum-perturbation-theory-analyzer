# Quantum-perturbation-theory-analyzer
A comprehensive Python tool for analyzing the quantum mechanical perturbation theory with energy level diagram wave function correction and exact solution in comparison

What the program does
Calculates first-order and second-order energy corrections
Plots energy level shifts
Shows wavefunctions:
unperturbed
perturbed
exact 'from diagonalization'
Compares perturbation theory with exact numerical results
Studies convergence by increasing the number of basis states
Can be used in interactive mode or command line mode

 
Output

The program produces:
Terminal output
Energy corrections
Errors compared to the exact solution
High-quality plots (300 DPI)
Wavefunction comparison
Probability densities
First-order corrections
Energy level diagram
Error analysis
Convergence with basis size
